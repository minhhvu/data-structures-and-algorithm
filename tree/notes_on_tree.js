/*
1. Definitions
  Tree: is a finite set of one or more nodes. There is one specically designated node call the root of tree.
  The remaining nodes are partitioned into m>0 disjoint set T1, T2, ... and each of these sets turn is a tree.
  --> Non-linear data structure, no cycle, each node has no more than 2 parents, only one root for one tree

  Search Tree: is a tree which each node n satisfies: all key values on left subtree < n < all key values on right subtree

  Binary Tree: is a tree which each node has at most two child nodes.

  Binary Search Tree: is tree which is a binary tree and is a search tree :D

  Trie

  B-tree

  (a,b)-tree
